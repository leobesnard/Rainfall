First, let's examine the binary to understand its protections and behavior: 

Let's see how the program behaves when run with different inputs: 

	level6@RainFall:~$ ./level6
	Segmentation fault (core dumped)

	level6@RainFall:~$ ./level6 test
	Nope

The program seems to take an argument and print "Nope". Now let's disassemble the code using GDB: 

See the assembly code in the ressources folder

Let's check what string is passed to system() in the n() function: 

	(gdb) x/s 0x80485b0
	0x80485b0: "/bin/cat /home/user/level7/.pass"
 
 
From our analysis, we understand that: 

    The program allocates two buffers on the heap: 
         buffer1: 64 bytes for storing user input from argv[1]
         buffer2: 4 bytes for storing a function pointer

It initializes the function pointer in buffer2 to point to function m() 
It copies argv[1] into buffer1 using strcpy() without any bounds checking 
Finally, it calls the function pointed to by the function pointer in buffer2 
     

Normally, this would call m() and print "Nope", but the vulnerability in strcpy() allows us to overflow buffer1 and potentially overwrite the function pointer in buffer2. 

The key vulnerability is the use of strcpy() without bounds checking: 

strcpy(buffer1, argv[1]);  // Vulnerable to buffer overflow
 
Since buffer1 is 64 bytes and strcpy() will copy until it hits a null byte, we can provide an input longer than 64 bytes to overflow buffer1 and overwrite adjacent memory on the heap. 

Given that: 

     buffer1 is allocated first with 64 bytes
     buffer2 is allocated second with 4 bytes
     buffer2 contains a function pointer that gets called
     

Our exploitation strategy is clear: we need to overwrite the function pointer in buffer2 with the address of n(), which will print the level7 password. 

The address of function n() is 0x08048454. However, we need to determine how many bytes to write before we reach buffer2 from buffer1. 

The heap layout isn't as straightforward as just 64 bytes for buffer1 followed immediately by buffer2. There's likely some metadata or padding between the allocations. 

Let's try different padding lengths to find the right offset: 

	level6@RainFall:~$ ./level6 $(python -c 'print "A"*72 + "\x54\x84\x04\x08"')

This command: 

     Creates a string with 72 'A' characters
     Appends the address of n() in little-endian format (\x54\x84\x04\x08)
     Passes this as an argument to ./level6
     

When executed, this successfully overwrites the function pointer and executes n(), which runs: 

	system("/bin/cat /home/user/level7/.pass")

Our exploit works because: 

    We overwrite the 64-byte buffer with 72 'A' characters, which fills: 
         The 64-byte buffer itself
         8 bytes of metadata/padding between the allocations
         

After these 72 bytes, we place the address of n() (0x08048454) 
When the program tries to call the function pointer, it executes n() instead of m() 
The n() function calls system("/bin/cat /home/user/level7/.pass"), printing the password 
     

The vulnerability could have been prevented by: 

     Using a bounds-checking function like strncpy() instead of strcpy()
     Validating the length of user input before copying it
     Implementing heap protections to detect buffer overflows
